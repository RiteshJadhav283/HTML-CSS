    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The Hennessey Venom GT is an American high-performance sports car manufactured by Texas-based Hennessey Performance Engineering. Based on the Lotus Exige, the Venom GT features a modified chassis and a twin-turbocharged V8 engine, making it one of the fastest production cars in the world.</p>
    <p>The Venom GT holds the record for the highest speed achieved by a production car (270.49 mph), though it wasn't officially recognized by Guinness World Records due to not meeting all their requirements. The car is known for its extreme acceleration, going from 0-200 mph in just 14.51 seconds.</p>
    
    <h2>Origins</h2>
    <p>The Venom GT project began in 2007 when John Hennessey decided to create the world's fastest production car. The car uses a modified Lotus Exige chassis that has been lengthened by 14 inches to accommodate the massive twin-turbo V8 engine. The first prototype was completed in 2010, with production models following shortly after.</p>
    <p>Hennessey chose the Lotus Exige as the base due to its lightweight construction and excellent handling characteristics. By combining this lightweight chassis with a powerful engine, the company created a car with an exceptional power-to-weight ratio.</p>
    
    <h2>Performance</h2>
    <p>The Venom GT's performance is staggering. The 7.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine produces 1,244 horsepower and 1,155 lb-ft of torque. This power, combined with the car's lightweight construction (2,743 lbs), results in a 0-60 mph time of just 2.7 seconds.</p>
    <p>The car's aerodynamics were carefully designed to provide stability at extreme speeds. At top speed, the Venom GT generates over 2,000 pounds of downforce to keep it planted to the road. The braking system uses massive carbon ceramic discs to bring the car from high speeds to a stop safely.</p>
    
    <h2>Records</h2>
    <p>In 2013, the Venom GT set a Guinness World Record for fastest production car from 0-300 km/h (186 mph) in just 13.63 seconds. In 2014, at the Kennedy Space Center, the Venom GT achieved a top speed of 270.49 mph, though this wasn't officially recognized by Guinness due to insufficient production numbers and only completing a one-way run.</p>
    <p>The car also holds records for fastest convertible (Venom GT Spyder) and several other acceleration records. These achievements cemented Hennessey's reputation as a builder of extreme performance vehicles.</p>
    
    <h2>Production</h2>
    <p>Hennessey planned to build just 29 Venom GTs (plus 12 Spyder convertibles), making it an extremely rare car. Each vehicle was hand-built at Hennessey's facility in Sealy, Texas, with extensive customization options available to buyers.</p>
    <p>Production ended in 2017 when Hennessey shifted focus to its next project, the Venom F5, which aims to break the 300 mph barrier. The limited production run and extreme performance have made the Venom GT a highly sought-after collector's car.</p>

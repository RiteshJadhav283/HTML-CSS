        <p><h1>HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</h1> HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is a markup language used to create web pages.<hr>
            It was created in 1990 by <b>Sir Tim Berners-Lee</b>, a British computer scientist who is credited with inventing the World Wide Web.
            [1] Webpages can include writing, links, pictures, and even sound and HTML tells web browsers what webpages should look like.
            HTML also adds meta information to webpages. Meta information is information about a webpage e.g., the name of the person who created the page.
            Web browsers usually do not show meta information. </p>
